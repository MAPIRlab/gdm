#                         Gas Distribution Mapping (GDM)
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->
This is a collection of Python scripts intended for GDM,
the estimation of how a gas is spread in a 2D/3D environment
from a small set of individual gas readings.
This teechnique is usually paired with mobile robots
to automate the task of collecting data,
but without requiring the robot the fully explore the area.

Each GDM technique/philosophy resides inside its own folder.
Please reffer to their individual README files for more information.
